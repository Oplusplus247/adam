Cyera Home Assignment 
General Instructions 
Time Allocation: Approximately 2-3 hours. 
Submission: Upload your project to GitHub and share the repository link with yuval.menashe@cyera.io. 
Testing Framework: The project must be implemented in Jest (Preferred), Pytest, or Junit. 
Requirements: 
1. Include a README file documenting the project structure, requirements, and instructions to run the application. 
2. Implement logging for both normal operations and exceptional events. 
3. Include appropriate error handling throughout the codebase. 
4. Ensure the code runs without crashes or unhandled exceptions. 
5. The project should include a basic automated reporting component. 
 
Good luck! 
 
Overview 
Our DSPM platform utilizes an event-driven architecture with Kafka. The Policy Engine consumes asset discovery events, evaluates them against defined security policies, and produces corresponding violation and remediation events. 
 
Event Flow: 
 

 
Kafka Topics: 
 
- dspm.discovery.asset (input) 
- dspm.policy.violation (output) 
- dspm.remediation.requested (output) 
 
Objective: Design and build an automated test framework to validate the Policy Engine's behavior. 
Task Description 
You are required to design and implement an automated test framework with the following capabilities: 
 
1. Publishes asset discovery events to Kafka. 
2. Consumes violation and remediation events from Kafka. 
3. Validates the Policy Engine's outputs. 
 
Scope: 
- High-level test plan. 
- Implement test scenarios that cover a variety of use cases. 
- Include multiple layers of testing, such as component and end-to-end tests. 
- Validate aspects you deem critical (e.g., event structure, business logic, timing, event correlation). 
 
Useful Information: 
 
- Use the supplied mock service for integration and self-testing (see instructions below). 
- For additional help, refer to the provided Kafka and Policies documentation files. 
 
 
Running the Mock Service 
Prerequisites 
Before starting, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. 
 
Note: All Python dependencies for the mock service are automatically installed inside the Docker container. You do not need to manually install `requirements.txt`. 
Starting the Infrastructure 

 
Allow approximately 30 seconds for all services to initialize. 
Verifying Service Status 

Kafka Configuration 
- Bootstrap Server: localhost:9092 
- Topics: Automatically created upon service startup
