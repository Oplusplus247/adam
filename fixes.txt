Race Conditions & Memory Leaks (helpers/kafkaHelpers.js)

Fixed an issue where Kafka consumers kept running after timeouts, causing memory leaks and test interference
Added proper cleanup to ensure consumers stop gracefully

Test Stability (helpers/testBase.js)

Tests were occasionally colliding when run quickly (same group IDs generated in same millisecond)
Now using counter + process ID + timestamp combo for truly unique IDs

Better Error Handling

helpers/kafkaHelpers.js - Collectors now fail independently instead of taking down the whole test
helpers/testBase.js - Empty results returned on failure instead of crashes
helpers/logger.js - Logger won't break tests even if file writing fails

Code Quality

helpers/validators.js (new) - Added schema validators for all event types (discovery, violations, remediations)
helpers/fixtures.js (new) - Created test fixtures for consistent test data across suites
helpers/testBase.js - Added comments explaining the magic numbers (400ms, 7000ms timeouts)

Test Reporter (reporters/simpleJsonReporter.js)

Minor null safety improvements to handle edge cases
